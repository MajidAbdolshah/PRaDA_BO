\chapter{Introduction}
Bayesian optimisation is considered to be the specific case of model-based optimisation methods which is structured based on the Bayesian formulations. Like the most cases of Bayesian approaches, there is a prior distribution over a function, a likelihood function, and a posterior distribution over the unknown functions given data \cite{gelbart2015constrained}. Bayesian optimisation aims to solve a difficult though concise problem:
\begin{equation}
	\operatorname*{min}_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x)	
\label{eq:ch1_1}
\end{equation}
