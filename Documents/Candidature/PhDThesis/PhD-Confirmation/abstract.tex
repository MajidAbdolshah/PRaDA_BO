Bayesian optimisation has become a powerful framework for global optimisation of black-box functions that are expensive to evaluate and possibly noisy. In addition to expensive evaluation of objective functions, many real-world optimisation problems deal with similarly expensive black-box constraints. However, there are few studies regarding multi-objective scenarios and the role of potential challenges such as constraints, real-time optimisation and objective ranking in multi-objective Bayesian optimisation. In this report, we will elaborate on potential extensions and improvements of Expected Hypervolume Improvement as a novel path through further improvement of multi-objective Bayesian optimisaion. We believe that by introducing expectation of constraints satisfaction and merging them into a novel acquisition function, we can fulfill one of the challenges in multi-objective Bayesian optimisation. Also we analyse the potential problems of existing objective rankings and their importance in real-world multi-objective problems based on Bayesian optimisation. Finally we have narrowed down interesting research problems in multi-objective Bayesian optimisation related to Robotics and complex parameter sets. 
%For the first approach, We analyse the performance of proposed method by estimating the feasible region dominated by Pareto front using 6 benchmark functions.
%The proposed method is also evaluated on a real-world problem of Alloy Design. We demonstrate that EHVIC is an effective algorithm that provides a promising performance by comparing to a well-known related method. We have also introduced other evaluation methods for further research problems.
